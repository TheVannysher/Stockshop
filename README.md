Here is my small project.

I have done what I could to follow the rules.


## Optionnal Challenge
  - [X] Test components in addition to the recommendation algorithm.
        ** Snapshots for a component **
  - [X] - Allow your users to add / remove any social media service from the system on the fly.
  
  - [X] Architect your app such that recommendation algorithms are easily switched. 
    `I have made the recommendation algorithm a simple function`
    `It could easily be switched for another function`
    
  - [ ] Some of your customers might be visually impaired. It would be nice if theyâ€™re able to use the
        app as well.
        
  - [X] Build a graph (feel free to use a library to help with this part) indicating the points where your
        algorithm will change the buy/hold/sell recommendation.
        `partially done, my grpah only shows current data and recommand action based on today's value`
        
  - [X] Recommendation algorithms may require more than just price and social media counts. In the
        app, account for how different algorithms can require different parameters.
        `I introduced a concept of tolerance wich is scaling based on price and social media mentions count`
